## About me
I've completed my PhD at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [William Noble](https://noble.gs.washington.edu/~wnoble/) and [Sewoong Oh](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/). My PhD research built deep learning methods to model biological sequences, chiefly in mass spectrometry-based proteomics.

Previously, I was a research intern at Amazon, Alphabet (Calico Life Sciences), Novo Nordisk and Stanford BMIR. I received a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Koc University, where I worked with [Murat Tekalp](http://home.ku.edu.tr/~mtekalp/).

Pursuing my passion for biotech entrepreneurship and community building, I've founded the Pacific Northwest chapter of [Nucleate](https://nucleate.xyz/), a global trainee-led nonprofit supporting emerging entrepreneurs in biotech and helping them spin out of academic labs. (featured in [GeekWire](https://www.geekwire.com/2022/biotech-training-camp-founded-by-students-launches-in-seattle/))
