I'm a second-year PhD student at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), where I'm fortunate to be working with [William Noble](https://noble.gs.washington.edu/~wnoble/). My research interests are in Machine Learning, Computational Biology and Biomedical Data Science. Focusing on proteomics, my current research builds deep learning methods to analyze mass spectrometry data.

Previously, I was a Research Intern at [Stanford BMIR](https://bmir.stanford.edu) with [Tina Hernandez-Boussard](https://med.stanford.edu/boussard-lab/people/tina_hernandez_boussard.html). I received a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Koc University, where I worked with [Murat Tekalp](http://home.ku.edu.tr/~mtekalp/).
